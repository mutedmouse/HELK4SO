# HELK4SO
NOTE: I am currently testing and completing trials in a lab environment but will post the alpha version as soon as those tests ested are completed.  Thank you for your patience.

This repository is for integrating HELK capabilities into Security Onion instances.

This will be an evolving extension to both products and as such this not contributed directly to either the HELK or SecurityOnion.

Please both use at your own risk and enjoy.

APLHA: Should be posted 7 March, 2019

Configs pulled from: https://github.com/Cyb3rWard0g/HELK
 - Modifications will be documented thoroughly in accordance with ensuring coexistence with Security Onion configurations
Installed on ISO from: https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/security-onion
 - Modifications will be heavily documented to ensure proper functionality of requisite Security Onion facilities

HUGE thank yous to both Doug Burks and Roberto Rodriguez for their incredible contributions to the community! Please contact them  for technical support relating to their individual platforms.  I simply mashed the two projects together and provide a method for practical applications.  To all who have been instrumental in this project I cannot express my grattitue enough. 

Current TODO:
- Integrate XENITY config script for rapid implementations
- Complete integrated testing and deployment in all three security sensor configurations
- Collocate and deconflict sensor and host interface via automatic BPF filter
