# HELK4SO
NOTE: I am currently testing and completing trials in a lab environment but will post the alpha version as soon as those tests ested are completed.  Thank you for your patience.

This repository is for integrating HELK capabilities into Security Onion instances.

This will be an evolving extension to both products and as such this not contributed directly to either the HELK or SecurityOnion.

Please both use at your own risk and enjoy.

APLHA: Should be posted 7 March, 2019
