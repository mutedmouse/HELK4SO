# HELK4SO
STATUS: host-setup.sh script has been tested and is currently stable. Please use with latest security onion iso. Execution should be performed from inside the HELK4SO directory.

Please see Installation Guide at https://github.com/mutedmouse/HELK4SO/wiki/2:-Installation for step-by-step installation details and instructions

This repository is for integrating HELK capabilities into Security Onion instances.

This will be an evolving extension to both products and as such this not contributed directly to either the HELK or SecurityOnion.

Please both use at your own risk and enjoy.


Configs pulled from: https://github.com/Cyb3rWard0g/HELK
 - Modifications will be documented thoroughly in accordance with ensuring coexistence with Security Onion configurations

Installed on ISO from: https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/security-onion
 - Modifications will be heavily documented to ensure proper functionality of requisite Security Onion facilities

HUGE thank yous to both Doug Burks and Roberto Rodriguez for their incredible contributions to the community! Please contact them  for technical support relating to their individual platforms.  I simply mashed the two projects together and provide a method for practical applications.  To all who have been instrumental in this project I cannot express my grattitue enough. 

Current TODO:
- Complete Guide with Images
- Automate dashboard and mapping imports on master system
- Collocate and deconflict network sensor interface and host collection interface via automatic BPF filter
